My site: https://kwintenolaerts.github.io/Redline/ <br>
The original site: http://www.hc-rhino.be/ <br>

Concept: Improve a random website that needs work, assigned by my coach @Thijs Lambert. <br>
Timeframe: 1 work-day. <br>
Working method: Used bootstrap, SCSS (sass) and got most of my information from their original site. <br>
I also got some pictures from their facebook page, and re-wrote most of the used text because it was badly writtin. <br>

Most def. enjoyed this fun and relatively easy project. <br>
